Most conventional hardware to use while presenting, keyboard, myo, clickers, are lacking in some aspect. Keyboards will limit your body movements, myo is very inaccurate, and clickers are to straight forward. Our product, F-0, has been designed with the idea of perfecting comfort and useability.

1. Simple: F-0 has less operations that are easily programmable so that you can focus on your presentation rather then remembering the complex computer that you sometimes hold in your hands.
2. Customizable: We want your presentation to fit you, the feel of your hardware being an extention of your body. You can program buttons so that you can give the most comfortable presentation on stage.
3. Comfortable: The F-0 fits perfectly on your hand, with ergonomic design you can seemlessly operate your presentation at the highest level of comfort.
4. Accurate: The microcontroller that controls the device is set on a delay so that your presentation can seem smooth without mistakes as you get a second chance to decide your actions. No more miss clicks to mess up your flow on stage.
5. Realtime Feedback: Our device has a pager motor incorporated into the device so that you can get physical cues in your presentation that you can set before. A simple vibration can tell you when you have an important slide coming up next.
6. Community: We hope to get a open culture with our product with everyone contributing their body language data online. This way you can help to perfect your presentation in the fastest way possible. (talk about the acceleromiter and gyroscope to record your body movemets and compare them to known great presenters)
<br/>

In all we had the idea of you presenting your information in the easy and simple yet complex way possible. The F-0 allows you achieve a higher level of control and customizability with just 4 simple buttons.
